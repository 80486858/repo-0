# Quickstart Guide to Gatsby

If it's a first time installation, [do these *first two* steps](https://github.com/adobe/aio-theme#using-the-adobe-io-cli). You don't need to "create" the site.


Then run this (once?):
```
npm install
```

To preview the site:
```
npm run build
```

Every time you make a change you have to clean and then build again:
```
npm run clean
```
