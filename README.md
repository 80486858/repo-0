# auth0-cli

## What?

The goal is to build a fully fleshed out product, similar to the Heroku CLI,
Stripe CLI, etc.

## Why now?

- It would also allow MVP products to be shipped faster.
- For actions, delivering a CLI experience would be far ideal than having
  developers write code in the browser.
