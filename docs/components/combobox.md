# Combobox

It allows not only to enter a value, but also to choose from a dropdown list of predefined values. The combo box consists of two parts, a field for entering a value and a button with a dropdown list. The input field inherits the behavior of the Input component, and a click on the button causes dropdown. The dropdown list inherits the dropdown behavior logic for the select component.
