# How to build UI Component library

UI component library build process is based on Vite.
Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

You can build it locally for development purposes.
For production, we use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/acronis/ui-component-library/actions/workflows/ui-npm-publish.yml) to build and publish the library to the npm registry.
