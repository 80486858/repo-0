# Linting source code

Linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors.
This is done by using a linter, which is a tool that will check the code for programmatic and stylistic errors.
Linters are used to ensure that code is consistent and error-free.

## Why linting is important

Linting is important because it helps to catch errors early in the development process.
This can help to prevent bugs and other issues from occurring in the final product.
Linting can also help to ensure that code is consistent and follows best practices.

## How to lint code

We use eslint and @antfu/eslint-config with flat config to lint our code.
Eslint is a popular linter that can be used to check JavaScript code for errors.

To lint code using eslint, you can run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```
