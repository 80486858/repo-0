# Managing issues workflow

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests.
And we use GitHub projects to track the progress of the issues.

All issues are public except for security issues.

Typical workflow for any issue is:

- Issues are created by anyone with a GitHub account.
- Issues are triaged by the team or moved to `Todo`.
- Issues are labeled and prioritized, sorted to milestones and sprints.
- Issues are assigned to a team member, according team capacity, priority, and complexity.
- Once design is ready, issues are moved to `Ready`.
- Issues are developed and moved to `In Progress`.
- Issues are reviewed by designers and QA and moved to `In Review`.
- Issues are resolved and closed to `Done`.
