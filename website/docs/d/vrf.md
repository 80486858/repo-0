# netbox_vrf (Data Source)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/ipam/vrf/):

> A VRF object in NetBox represents a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) domain. Each VRF is essentially a separate routing table. VRFs are commonly used to isolate customers or organizations from one another within a network, or to route overlapping address space (e.g. multiple instances of the 10.0.0.0/8 space).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "netbox_vrf" "cust-a-prod" {
    name = "cust-a-prod"
}
```
