# netbox_available_ip_address (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/ipam/ipaddress/):

> An IP address comprises a single host address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and its subnet mask. Its mask should match exactly how the IP address is configured on an interface in the real world.
> Like a prefix, an IP address can optionally be assigned to a VRF (otherwise, it will appear in the "global" table). IP addresses are automatically arranged under parent prefixes within their respective VRFs according to the IP hierarchy.
>
> Each IP address can also be assigned an operational status and a functional role. Statuses are hard-coded in NetBox and include the following:
>
> - Active
> - Reserved
> - Deprecated
> - DHCP
> - SLAAC (IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)

This resource will retrieve the next available IP address from a given prefix (specified by ID)

## Example Usage

### Marking an IP reserved
```terraform
data "netbox_prefix" "test" {
	cidr = "10.0.0.0/24"
}

resource "netbox_available_ip_address" "test" {
  prefix_id = data.netbox_prefix.test.id
  status = "reserved"
  dns_name = "test.mydomain.local"
}
```

### Marking an IP active and assigning to interface

```terraform
// Assumes Netbox already has a VM whos name matches 'dc-west-myvm-20'
data "netbox_virtual_machine" "myvm" {
    name_regex = "dc-west-myvm-20"
}

data "netbox_prefix" "test" {
	cidr = "10.0.0.0/24"
}

resource "netbox_interface" "myvm-eth0" {
    name = "eth0"
    virtual_machine_id = data.netbox_virtual_machine.myvm.id
}

resource "netbox_available_ip_address" "myvm-ip" {
    prefix_id = data.netbox_prefix.test.id
    status = "active"
    interface_id = netbox_interface.myvm-eth0.id
}
```
