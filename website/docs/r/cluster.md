# netbox_cluster (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core-functionality/virtualization/):

> A cluster is a logical grouping of physical resources within which virtual machines run. A cluster must be assigned a type (technological classification), and may optionally be assigned to a cluster group, site, and/or tenant.
>
> Physical devices may be associated with clusters as hosts. This allows users to track on which host(s) a particular virtual machine may reside. However, NetBox does not support pinning a specific VM within a cluster to a particular host device.
