# netbox_device_role (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/dcim/devicerole/):

> Devices can be organized by functional roles, which are fully customizable by the user. For example, you might create roles for core switches, distribution switches, and access switches within your network.

Device Roles must have a color - this is used to help visually distinguish and group devices in various Netbox UI elements.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_device_role" "core-sw" {
    color_hex = "FF00FF"
    name = "core-sw"
}
