# netbox_interface (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/dcim/interface/):

> Interfaces in NetBox represent network interfaces used to exchange data with connected devices. On modern networks, these are most commonly Ethernet, but other types are supported as well. Each interface must be assigned a type, and may optionally be assigned a MAC address, MTU, and IEEE 802.1Q mode (tagged or access).
