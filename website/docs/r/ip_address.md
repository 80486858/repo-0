# netbox_ip_address (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/ipam/ipaddress/):

> An IP address comprises a single host address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and its subnet mask. Its mask should match exactly how the IP address is configured on an interface in the real world.
> Like a prefix, an IP address can optionally be assigned to a VRF (otherwise, it will appear in the "global" table). IP addresses are automatically arranged under parent prefixes within their respective VRFs according to the IP hierarchy.
>
> Each IP address can also be assigned an operational status and a functional role. Statuses are hard-coded in NetBox and include the following:
>
> - Active
> - Reserved
> - Deprecated
> - DHCP
> - SLAAC (IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)
