# netbox_service (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/ipam/service/):

> A service represents a layer four TCP or UDP service available on a device or virtual machine. For example, you might want to document that an HTTP service is running on a device. Each service includes a name, protocol, and port number; for example, "SSH (TCP/22)" or "DNS (UDP/53)."

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Assumes Netbox already has a VM whos name matches 'dc-west-myvm-20'
data "netbox_virtual_machine" "myvm" {
    name_regex = "dc-west-myvm-20"
}

resource "netbox_service" "ssh" {
    name = "ssh"
    ports = [22]
    protocol = "TCP"
    virtual_machine_id = data.netbox_virtual_machine.myvm.id
}
```
