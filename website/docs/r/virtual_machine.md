# netbox_virtual_machine (Resource)

Per [the docs](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core-functionality/virtualization/):

> A virtual machine represents a virtual compute instance hosted within a cluster. Each VM must be assigned to exactly one cluster.
> Like devices, each VM can be assigned a platform and/or functional role, and must have one of the following operational statuses assigned to it:
> 
> - Active
> - Offline
> - Planned
> - Staged
> - Failed
> - Decommissioning
> 
> Additional fields are available for annotating the vCPU count, memory (GB), and disk (GB) allocated to each VM. A VM may be allocated a partial vCPU count (e.g. 1.5 vCPU).
> Each VM may optionally be assigned to a tenant. Virtual machines may have virtual interfaces assigned to them, but do not support any physical component.
